## Fifty & Fifty Cohort Analysis 
### By Schuyler Blasy
#### Who are the top/best clients for Fifty & Fifty's Donately App, why are they the best, and what characterstics do they share?
Fifty and Fifty is a marketing firm with an app called Donately which organizations can use to allow donors to directly contribute through their org's website through a simple UI. The data was provided and aggregated from a variety of sources, and needed considerable cleaning. The remaining useful features were the total revenue generated by the app and the number of donation counts the app is getting per client, with an obvious positive correlation between those features. The results showed a very unambiguous three clusters, with a relatively small but significant cluster standing out as the top tier consumers of the app. Further qualitative research showed the top tier all sharing remarkably similar business characteristics which were highly indicative of their collective success..</br></br> I also performed a linear regression with a log-log transform showing the elasticity between the number of donations and donation counts. This analysis was able to highlight certain outliers in the data and where the app was likely not being used properly.
